# Custom One Time Password Input Field

Something which always catches my eye when I log in to a platform with MFA enabled is how well, and how not-so well some companies handle OTP inputs. I have built a OTP before using Vue 3 for an old employer who offered a SAAS product, so MFA was always an important aspect, however I've always thought how much my previous work could be improved, especially after now unlocking the super power of React.

This has inspired me to put my React skills to the test, and create a OTP 'micro project' - but also document my learnings, challenges, and solutions.
